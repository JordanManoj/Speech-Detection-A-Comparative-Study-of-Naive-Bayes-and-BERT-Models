# Speech-Detection-A-Comparative-Study-of-Naive-Bayes-and-BERT-Models
This project focuses on detecting toxic language in text data using two approaches â€” a traditional machine learning model (Naive Bayes) and a state-of-the-art deep learning model (BERT). The dataset consists of online comments labeled as toxic or non-toxic.
